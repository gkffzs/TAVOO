## TAVOO *(to be updated)*
This repository contains the files for [**TAVOO**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.upatras.ceid.kaffezas.tavoo), an Android application that I partially developed as part of my diploma thesis. The main goal of my thesis was the improvement of the cohabitation between humans and pets, with the aid of modern technology and its ability to have a positive impact towards that goal, but also with the active participation of users themselves. So, this mobile application was designed and partially developed, according to the principles of [human-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) and with the user's opinion and experience in mind, on every stage of the process.

This is the [pre-alpha version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) of the application, so there is a lot to be done till it's properly completed. For this application to work properly, [**TAVOO API**](https://github.com/gkffzs/TAVOO-API) is needed.
